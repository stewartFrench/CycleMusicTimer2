Manage Your Drills While Teaching a Cycle Class

CycleTimer2 is a free app that runs on iPads and iPhones and is particularly useful for spin class teachers.  
It displays playlists, tracks, a music player, and your own custom exercise drills that are easily 
read from a stationary bike when your iPad or iPhone is over on the stereo stack.

The large time display counts down from the track's maximum duration to zero. 
On an iPad, CycleTimer2 runs in landscape orientation. 
On an iPhone, CycleTimer2 runs in portrait orientation.  

The app presents the playlists from the Apple device's music library. 
Choose a playlist and the app shows the tracks within that playlist. 
Each track has a time, in blue, showing the remaining minutes and seconds in the playlist, 
counting this track. 
Choose a track and the app shows the music player.

Beneath the countdown timer there is a large area where you can create, edit, and save exercise drill notes.  
The drill notes can be copied and pasted into other tracks drill notes using standard iOS touch editing methods.

A drill note is associated with an Artist name and Track title. 
By default a track will have the same drill note even if it appears in several playlists. 
While editing a drill note you can set a switch to make the track's drill note only 
apply in the current playlist. Using this switch you can have the same track appear 
in several playlists with different drill notes for each.

Please let me know if you find any bugs or want some improvement.
Also, if you take these sources and make changes, please let me know so I can 
consider adding them.
